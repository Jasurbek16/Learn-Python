# Single underscores are a Python naming convention that indicates a
# name is meant for internal use.

# In summary, a single trailing underscore (postfix) is used by convention
# to avoid naming conflicts with Python keywords.

# A double underscore prefix causes the Python interpreter to rewrite
# the attribute name in order to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses.

# Names that have both leading and trailing double underscores
# are reserved for special use in the language. This rule covers
# things like __init__ for object constructors, or __call__ to make objects
# callable.

# Besides its use as a temporary variable, “_” is a special variable in most
# Python REPLs that represents the result of the last expression evaluated
# by the interpreter.
