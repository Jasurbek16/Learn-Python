'''Copying mutable collections like lists, dicts, and sets'''

# ^ However, this method wonâ€™t work for custom objects and, on top of
# that, it only creates shallow copies which means that both lists share
# the same child objects.
# copy.copy() <- is also possible to make a shallow copy
# Pythonic to simply use the list, dict, and set factory functions 
# to create
# shallow copies.
